    temperatureTip: 'Temperature parameter affects the randomness of the text generated by the model. It is a positive number, usually between 0 and 1. When the temperature value is higher (e.g., close to 1), the model will be more inclined to explore different outputs, which may include more surprising answers. Lower temperature values (e.g., close to 0) make the model more likely to choose outputs with high confidence, possibly resulting in more conservative and deterministic answers. The temperature value can be adjusted to achieve appropriate results based on the use case and desired output type.',

    top_pTip: 'Top_p parameter is used to control the probability mass considered during the generation process. The Top_p value is between 0 and 1, usually set to 0.9 or other higher values. During the generation process, the model filters words based on the given Top_p value, and only words with cumulative probabilities above the Top_p threshold are considered. Lower Top_p values make the output more diverse while potentially reducing text quality. Higher Top_p values make the model more inclined to generate relatively deterministic outputs, but may sacrifice diversity.',
